Naramata Vineyard

# Naramata Vineyard

## Overview

Explore the Naramata Vineyard website, designed as the operational center for our esteemed Bed & Breakfast, owned by my parents. This platform facilitates seamless booking processes for guests, reflecting a commitment to excellence in hospitality. Engage with the sophisticated interface, ensuring a smooth experience for both guests and proprietors alike, as we invite you to discover the unparalleled charm of our B&B."

### Problem

In response to the increasing fees imposed by platforms like Airbnb and VRBO, my parents have chosen a strategic path to independence. This decision allows them greater control over their business operations, avoiding the escalating fees associated with booking platforms. Taking charge of their business gives my parents more freedom and create a guest experience that's more to their style.

### User Profile

Residing in a sought-after tourist destination, where demand for accommodations surges during the spring, summer, and fall seasons, this initiative will play a pivotal role in facilitating lodging arrangements for guests exploring the Okanagan region.

Vacation planning and bookings can be stressful; my aim is to streamline this process for guests and alleviate the operational burden on my parents managing the business. The objective is to enhance overall efficiency and ensure a seamless experience for both travelers and proprietors alike.

## Roadmap

The Okanagan is a seasonal destination, the website will need to be functioning with the basic booking components by Spring time, which will allow myself more time this winter to add more features.

two weeks time:

1. should have the main portion of the website, the designs with HTML and CSS

December:

1. Have booking calendar intergrated and functioning through APIs
2. Add weather API

January

1. Find safe payment payment processors to have the feature up and running

February:

1. Create database to hold booking details, customer accounts are not required at this time

2. Once payment processors, data base and calendar are functioning - guests will be able to book their reservations

3. Main booking communication with be through email for the first year

October:

1. with the summer over, take the time to review how the summer went and any new features we may need. ie. will it be more benefical to have customer accounts?

## Nice-to-haves

Once our first season is complete, it will be a great time to reflect on what features the website may need for the next season:

1. Open Table (other booking systems) intergrations to book dining/event reservations online

2. More advanced messaging services for chats, such an an AI chat bot guests can communicate with before booking, and live chats/messages once guests book

3. Mobile App, once guests have paid for their reservation, a link to a private app would be sent via email. This app would allow them to have a the private messaging service, online bookning, weather information, local activities etc..
